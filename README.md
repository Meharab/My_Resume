## Projects:
* [iOS to-do-list App](https://github.com/Meharab/iOS_To-Do-List_App):
I used xcode9 framework to develop this application using objective-c programming language. I also used recycle view and user can swip to delete easily. user can also tap 
to mark and unmark the task. I also keep the interface very basic so that anyone can interact with the app very easily.

* [Decentralized Voting Dapp](https://github.com/Meharab/Voting-Dapp):
I used HTML CSS and Javascript for frontend and also used Boostrap and jQuery framework and library to make the user interface more dynamic. In the backend part I useed two servers. Apache web server is used to store login information and other information of voters. in this case i used php programming language to interact with interface.On the other hand the voting process carries on the Ethereum blockchain. To emulate this i used Node.js as a server and used Javascript programming language and Express.js framework to interact with the interface. I also used Solidity programming language to write the code of Smart-Contact. I also use Matamax wallet and Web3.js library to interact with blockchain. And to simulate the blockchain I used Ganache local blockchain platform.

* [Responsive Restaurant Webapp using Bootstrap-4](https://github.com/Meharab/Restaurant-Webapp-using-Bootstrap-V4):
I used the Bootstrap version 4 along with HTML 5. For styling I used CSS 3 and also CSS framework SCSS and Less. I used vanilla javascript and jQuery to show some of the bootstrap techniques. to make my work easier I automated my development process using NPM and I also used task-runner Grunt and Gulp plugins. It is a responsive site which is developed under mobile-first approach.
