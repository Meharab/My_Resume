## OBJECTIVE
I am very passionate about computer and programming since my university life. I dream to be 
an expert software engineer so that I can build professional and useful software that has 
business value. I am looking for a opportunity to work in a reputed software company that
can help me to achieve my goal.


## TECHNICAL SKILLS
* **Languages:** Solidity, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, C/C++.
* **Frameworks:** Truffle, Ethereum.
* **Other:** Git/GitHub, MS-PowerPoint/Word.


## Projects:
* [iOS to-do-list App](https://github.com/Meharab/iOS_To-Do-List_App):
I used xcode9 framework to develop this application using objective-c programming 
language. I also used recycle view and user can swip to delete easily. user can also tap 
to mark and unmark the task. I also keep the interface very basic so that anyone can 
interact with the app very easily.

* [Decentralized Voting Dapp](https://github.com/Meharab/Voting-Dapp):
I used HTML CSS and Javascript for frontend and also used Boostrap and jQuery 
framework and library to make the user interface more dynamic. 
In the backend part I useed two servers. Apache web server is used to store login 
information and other information of voters. in this case i used php programming 
language to interact with interface.
On the other hand the voting process carries on the Ethereum blockchain. To emulate 
this i used Node.js as a server and used Javascript programming language and 
Express.js framework to interact with the interface. I also used Solidity programming 
language to write the code of Smart-Contact. I also use Matamax wallet and Web3.js 
library to interact with blockchain. And to simulate the blockchain I used Ganache local 
blockchain platform.
